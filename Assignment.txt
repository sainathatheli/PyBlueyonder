Dictionary:
===========
1)Write a program that reads string from user. Your program should create a dictionary having key as word length and value is count of words of that length. For example, if user enters 'A fat cat is on the mat'.

Word	Word length
A	1
fat	3
cat	3
is	2
on	2
the	3
mat	3

2)Write a program to read 6 numbers and create a dictionary having keys EVEN and ODD. Dictionary's value should be stored in list. Your dictionary should be like:
{'EVEN':[8,10,64], 'ODD':[1,5,9]}


Exercises on Files
===================
1)Write a program that writes 10 random numbers to a file 'numbers.txt'. Each random number should be in the range of 1 through 100(hint use random module-->randominit())

2)Write a program that reads and display all of the numbers stored in the file numbers.txt (created in      question 1) and calculates their total.

3)Write a function, digit_count() in Python that counts and displays the number of digits in the text file named 'sample.txt'. 
For example, if the content of 'sample.txt' is as follows :
The team achieved a milestone in 2023. They completed a multi-million-dollar project ahead of schedule. Stakeholders were impressed with a 98% success rate.

The function should display the output as 6

4)Write a function lines_count() that reads lines from a text file named 'zen.txt' and displays the lines that begin with any vowel. Assume the file contains the following text and already exists on the computer's disk:

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.

The lines_count() function should display the output as:
Explicit is better than implicit.
